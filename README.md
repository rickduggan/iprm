# ip-request-mapper

When a user visits a web site, the actual request to the web site is converted into individual requests for each element on the page, e.g. images, fonts, css, text, and the like. This Chrome extension follows each request and places it onto a map so the user can more easily visualize both where the page elements are fetched from as well as the sheer number of requests included in each visit to a web site.

To compile the ts, use "tsc" or "npx tsc"
